          Seal, any of 32 species of web-footed aquatic mammals that live chiefly in cold seas and 
          whose body shape, round at the middle and tapered at the ends, is adapted to swift and 
          graceful swimming. There are two types of seals: the earless, or true, seals (family Phocidae); 
          and the eared seals (family Otariidae), which comprise the sea lions and fur seals. In addition 
          to the presence of external ears, eared seals have longer flippers than do earless seals. Also, 
          the fur of eared seals is more apparent, especially in sea lions.
